			<h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
			<p>This is a 6-week project for a senior-design directed study, the premise of this project was to identify an opportunity that can be solved through a design intervention for RIOT Games - League of Legends Championship Series. The intervention needed to be backed by design decisions, evidence and a clear rationale that encompassed both user and business value.</p>

			<h3 class ="extra-top-padding">THE INTERVENTION</h3>
			<p>This project is focused on creating the ultimate fan experience, providing immersive pre-game, live-game and post-game coverage for LCS fans. Our digital intervention features interactive maps, in-game predictions and an elevated chat experience, delivering the ultimate fan engagement.</p>

				<h3>LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</h3>
				<p>The League Championship Series or LCS is the third most-watched sports league in North America behind only the NFL and NBA acting as the premier competition in North America for League of Legends; a competitive video game that has become one of the most popular e-sports on the planet.</p>

				<p>Despite the growth of esports, LCS has been experiencing a steadily declining viewership (From 2017 to 2022 the average viewership dropped from 150,254 viewers in 2017 to 123,144 in 2022) with many fans expressing discontent with the league’s “boring product.” There is thus an opportunity to intervene in the pre-watching experience within digital and physical realms in order to increase viewership and engagement. </p>
